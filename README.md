## Overview

The **U.S. Life Expectancy Explorer** allows users to analyze life expectancy trends across U.S. counties. It provides insights into disparities between urban and rural areas, examining factors such as healthcare, obesity rates, air pollution, and socioeconomic status. Users can explore these factors interactively through maps, statistical summaries, and regression analysis.

## Features

- **Life Expectancy Map**: Visualizes life expectancy across U.S. counties using a scatter map with interactive filtering by state and year.
- **Statistical Summaries**: Provides detailed statistics such as mean and median life expectancy, along with the counties closest to these values.
- **Correlation and Regression Analysis**: Users can analyze the relationship between various factors and life expectancy through correlation matrices and regression plots.
- **Video Background**: The app features an engaging video background for enhanced user experience.
  
## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/life-expectancy-explorer.git
    cd life-expectancy-explorer
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download the dataset**:
   Place the `chr_census_featured_engineered.csv` dataset inside the `data` folder. The dataset should contain life expectancy data across U.S. counties.
